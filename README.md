# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs

## Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing medical insurance costs for various patients. The goal was to understand the factors that may influence insurance charges and to gain insights into the data through various statistical methods and visualizations.

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **age**: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- **sex**: Insurance contractor gender, female or male.
- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body weight relative to height.
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance.
- **smoker**: Smoking status of the individual.
- **region**: The beneficiary's residential area in the US, divided into four regions.
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Analysis Performed
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculated the average age of the patients.
   - Counted the number of males and females in the dataset.
   - Identified unique regions and calculated the average yearly medical insurance charges.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Created scatter plots to visualize the relationship between age and insurance charges.
   - Generated box plots to compare insurance charges across different regions.
   - Used correlation matrices to identify relationships between numerical variables.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Performed a multiple linear regression analysis to understand the impact of various factors (age, BMI, number of children, etc.) on insurance charges.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics.
- **Statsmodels**: For performing the regression analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the factors affecting medical insurance costs in the US. By understanding these factors, insurance companies can better assess risk and set premiums accordingly.
